# matlab-jpeg 
# This is a course project which implements the baseline JPEG algorithm using Matlab
Pleas give me more time, I will finised it soon.

input :  the original image and a scalar for the quantization
output:  a bitstream consisting of a header and the data.
         the header contains information that specifies the two Huffman tables(one for the DC terms, and one for the AC terms);
         the data consist of two parts: the first part is the bit stream for the DC terms, and the second part is the bit stream for the                                AC terms
